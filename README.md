All the process to train, test and evaluate the model.

1- Download the dataset through tensorflow library.

2- Load the data, normalize, and change the shape of the arrays.

3- Define forward propagation function.

4- Define backpropagation function.

5- Define gradient descent with mini-batch function.

6- Train the model.

7- Test and evaluate the model with metrics and confusion matrix.
